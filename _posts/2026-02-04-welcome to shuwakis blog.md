## A place to think in public

I’ve built software for years without writing much about it. Most of the thinking stayed in my head, my code, or scattered notes. This blog changes that.

This space is where I’ll document ideas, trade-offs, mistakes, and patterns I encounter while building real systems—mostly pragmatic, occasionally opinionated, always grounded in practice.

If you’re expecting hype or motivational content, you won’t find it here. This is about **clarity**, **engineering judgment**, and **learning by building**.

## A note on my background

By training, I am a **pharmacist**.

That matters more than it might seem.

Pharmacy teaches you to think in terms of:
- **Safety before cleverness**
- **Systems with real-world consequences**
- **Edge cases that matter because people are involved**
- **Precision, verification, and auditability**

Those habits carried over naturally into how I approach software. I tend to be cautious with abstractions, skeptical of shortcuts, and very interested in how systems behave under stress, misuse, or long-term maintenance.

This blog sits at that intersection: healthcare-grade thinking applied to software engineering.

## What I work on

My work sits at the intersection of:

- Application development (desktop, mobile, and web)
- Backend systems and APIs
- Data modeling and persistence
- Architecture decisions in constrained environments
- Maintaining and evolving long-lived systems

Much of my experience comes from working solo on production systems—where there’s no architect to ask, no senior to defer to, and no room for theory that doesn’t survive contact with reality.

That context shapes how I think and how I write.

## What you can expect here

I’ll be writing about things like:

- Why certain designs look good on paper but fail in practice  
- Trade-offs between simplicity, performance, and correctness  
- Patterns that emerge when maintaining software over time  
- Refactoring decisions and the reasoning behind them  
- Mistakes I’ve made—and what they taught me  

Code may appear. Diagrams may appear. Opinions will definitely appear—but they’ll be explained, not asserted.

## Why write at all?

Writing forces precision.

If I can’t explain a design clearly, I probably don’t understand it well enough. This blog is a tool for sharpening that understanding—and if others find it useful, that’s a bonus.

Think of this as **engineering notes made public**.

## Who this is for

This blog is likely useful if you:

- Build real systems, not just demos  
- Care about maintainability more than trends  
- Prefer reasoning over recipes  
- Are comfortable questioning “best practices”  

If that sounds like you, welcome.

## What’s next

The next posts will dive straight into concrete topics—design decisions, architectural patterns, and lessons learned from actual codebases.

No announcements. No filler. Just work.
